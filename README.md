## Problem Statement
We had a lot of problems during COVID-19; people struggled to get clear guidance, and we still have that problem.
We can't all afford to go to the doctor on a regular basis.
opportunity
It also aids us in gathering data so that we can forecast the future scope.
Sometimes whenever we face some basic illness like common cough, headache,etc we usually scroll internet, rush to doctors and take heavy medicines. But we all know that some home remedies can help us in such a situation but for severe condition we can consult doctor. But on the same time, there are several resources for home remedies.

## Suggested Solution:
In the project I used Azure Cognitive service and fetch the data from the official government website to identify the issue
CovidBotForYou is a ChatBot based site, that provides home remedy for basic illness including common cough,headache,stomach pain,etc at one place, so that user can get their solutions at same place and they don't need to panic/confused because of several resources.

In this project, core Azure services are used, i.e.,

QnA Maker
Azure Bot Services
